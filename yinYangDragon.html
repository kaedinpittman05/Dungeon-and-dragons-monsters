		<h3> Legendary action</h3>
		
		<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. 
		Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's 
		turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Detect: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</li>
			<li> Tail Attack: The dragon makes a tail attack.</li>
			<li>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions): The dragon beats its wings.
			Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw
			or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. 
			The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		
		
		<h3> Abibities</h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Amphibious: The dragon can breathe air and water.</li>
			<li> Legendary Resistance (3/Day): If the dragon fails a saving throw, 
			it can choose to succeed instead.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h3> Actions </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Multiattack: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. 
			It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</li>
			<li> Bite: Melee Weapon Attack:+ 15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8)
			piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) Radiant and nacrotic damage</li>
			<li>Claw: Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage. </li>
			<li>Tail: Melee Weapon Attack: +15 to hit, reach 20 ft ., one target. Hit: 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. </li>
			<li> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a 
			DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of 
			each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect
			ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</li>
			<li> Yin Yang Breath (Recharge 5-6): The dragon exhales Pure energy in a 90-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line 
			must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 67 (15d8) Radiant and necrotic damage on a failed save, 
			or half as much damage on a successful one.</li>
